Understanding the Geico Car Repair Process
------------------------------------------

If you have auto insurance coverage and need vehicle repairs after an accident, the typical process includes:

1. Reporting the claim to your insurance provider
2. Getting a vehicle damage inspection
3. Receiving a repair estimate
4. Choosing a repair facility
5. Completing repairs and payment processing

Many insurers, including GEICO, may offer recommended repair networks. However, policyholders usually have the legal right to choose their own repair shop.

How Auto Insurance Repairs Work
-------------------------------

When filing a claim for vehicle damage, here’s what typically happens:

Claim Filing
^^^^^^^^^^^^
You submit details about the accident, including photos and documentation.

Damage Inspection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An adjuster evaluates the damage either in person or via digital inspection.

Estimate Approval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A repair estimate is reviewed and approved based on your coverage.

Repair Completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The vehicle is repaired at a certified body shop or your preferred mechanic.

Payment
^^^^^^^
Insurance pays according to policy terms, minus any deductible.

--------------------------------------------------

Choosing a Repair Shop

You generally have two options:

* Insurance-recommended repair facilities
* Independent repair shops of your choice

Before selecting a shop, consider:

* Certifications (ASE, I-CAR, manufacturer approvals)
* Warranty on repair work
* Customer reviews
* Estimated completion time
